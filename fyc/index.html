        <p>RUN DOWNHILL is the brainchild of multi-Grammy® Award-winning artist T.J. Troy, a Los Angeles-based musician/writer/producer, blending his original music, comic book art and narrative, and multimedia live performance into a single integrated ensemble. The group’s newest album features 10 new songs, 5 instrumental and 5 lyric-driven, brought to life with dramatic performances from the band’s core trio of T.J. (guitar, baritone guitar, drums/percussion, and voice), Nate LaPointe (electric guitar and pedal steel), and Adam Levy (bass), alongside the multi-talented guest artists joining the trio throughout the collection.</p>

        <p>In 9 original songs and one cover rendition of Will Oldham’s “Drinking Woman”, the record alternates between vocal-driven and instrumental songs, showcasing writer T.J. Troy’s melodic and lyric sensibilities alongside the talents of the album’s special guests:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Yasmine Azaiez - Violin (Late for work; running home, The Rattler)</li>
            <li>Joe Garza - Rhythm Guitar (Spaces that have been filled, Let It Roll)</li>
            <li>Jeff Jensen - Lead Electric Guitar (Spaces that have been filled)</li>
            <li>David Longoria - Trumpet (That I were Comatose, Let It Roll)</li>
            <li>Phil Parlapiano - Hammond B3 Organ (Drinking Woman, Hungry for Something, Spaces that have been filled)</li>
